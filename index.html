      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm a physics student in "Sapienza Università di Roma".<br>
        I am interested in many different topics, mostly I have been concerned with the study of systems composed of many - often interacting - components.
        <br>The 2 areas on which I have focused my Master studies are:<ul>
          <li>(Quantum) condesed matter: the study of stuff, in its most mundane forms (e.g. glass and water) and its most esotic ones (superfluids, superconducturos and many others).</li>
          
          <li>Statistical mechanics: the discipline that tries to make sense of the interaction between many (often ~10^23) components.</li>
      </ul>
    I am also particoularly interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics and in general in the history and philosophy of science.<br>
    My other big passions, outside of physics, are drawing and anything sea related (swimming, freediving, scuba diving, surfing...).

    You can get a rough idea of what I'm like from this list of heroes of mine: Pierre Gilles de Gennes, Enrico Fermi, Marie Curie, Alan Turing, Sylvia Earle, Oliver Sacks, Quentin Blake, Kim Jung Gi. 
  
    <br><br>From this list of my favourite books: The lord of the rings, The sirens of titan, IT, Maus, Enigma: la strana vita di Alan Turing.
